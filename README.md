# Hey there, Tomoko here!
This here is Zora-DS, the closest/oldest version of Zora that's closest to the original 1985 Master Copy!
usage is very straight forward, simply input 'help' into the console for a list of commands[^1]! 

As with every Zora project, it may recieve updates :3c
[^1]: Some may not work as expected
